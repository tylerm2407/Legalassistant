## 1. Project Overview

**CaseMate** is a personalized AI legal assistant that helps everyday people understand their legal rights, navigate disputes, and take concrete next steps.

### The Problem

The average US lawyer charges $349/hour. The average American earns $52,000/year. That gap means most people cannot afford legal guidance when they need it most. CaseMate closes that gap at $20/month.

**Market size:** 130M+ Americans cannot afford a lawyer when they need one. The US legal tech market is growing at 9% CAGR. At just 1% penetration of the underserved population, CaseMate represents a $360M ARR opportunity. The demand is massive, the incumbents are overpriced, and no one is doing persistent memory.

### Core Differentiator

Every Claude API call injects the user's complete legal profile as structured context. This means CaseMate remembers the user's state, housing situation, employment type, family status, active legal issues, and extracted legal facts across every conversation. Responses are never generic — they are always tailored to the user's specific legal situation and state laws.

### What CaseMate Is NOT

- **Not a lawyer.** CaseMate provides legal information, not legal advice.
- **Not a fintech/trading app.** The only domain knowledge is legal.
- Every substantive legal response includes a disclaimer recommending a licensed attorney for complex matters.

### Technical Architecture

CaseMate uses a **structured memory injection architecture** that is distinct from both conversation-history chatbots and RAG-based retrieval systems. Rather than embedding documents and retrieving by similarity, CaseMate maintains a structured Pydantic model (`LegalProfile`) that is auto-updated after every conversation turn via a secondary Claude call (`backend/memory/updater.py`). This creates a compounding knowledge effect: each conversation makes the next one more personalized. The profile is then combined with deterministic state-specific legal context (all 50 states, 10 domains) to produce a system prompt that grounds every response in the user's actual legal situation. This three-layer assembly (profile + state law + domain guidance) is an established pattern in vertical AI applications, applied here specifically to legal guidance with measurably more specific responses than conversation-history-only approaches.

### Memory Injection: Demonstrable Impact — The Pitch Centerpiece

**This table is the single most important artifact in the entire pitch.** It demonstrates the concrete, measurable difference between a generic chatbot and CaseMate's memory-injected responses. Lead with this in every presentation.

The same question — "My landlord is saying I owe $800 for the bathroom tiles" — produces fundamentally different responses depending on profile depth:

| Dimension | New user (no profile) | Sarah Chen (8 facts, 12 conversations) |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Statute cited** | Generic: "Most states require deposit return within 30 days" | Specific: M.G.L. c.186 §15B (MA security deposit law) |
| **Damage calculation** | None — "you may be entitled to your deposit back" | "$800 deposit + up to 3x damages = $3,200 potential recovery, because landlord failed to perform move-in inspection" |
| **Evidence leveraged** | None — asks user to describe their situation | References missing move-in inspection and pre-existing water damage photos already in profile |
| **Next step** | "Consider consulting a lawyer" | "Send a demand letter citing the missing inspection — I can generate one now" |
| **Response length** | ~200 words, 4 generic paragraphs | ~180 words, 3 targeted paragraphs with calculations |

This is the actual demo output, not a hypothetical. The profile injection transforms a $0-value generic chatbot response into a $349-value legal consultation.

**Architecture vs. existing legal AI patterns:** RAG-based systems (Harvey, Casetext) retrieve document chunks by semantic similarity — latency-heavy (~500ms retrieval), unable to compound structured user context across sessions, and prone to retrieving irrelevant chunks. Conversation-history systems (ChatGPT, Gemini) carry raw message history until the context window fills, then forget everything. CaseMate's three-layer assembly is O(1) regardless of conversation count: structured profile (not raw history) + deterministic statute lookup (not embedding search) + keyword classification at ~0ms (not LLM classification at ~2s). The result is faster, cheaper, and compounds indefinitely.

**Why the combination matters:** No individual component — FastAPI, Supabase, Claude API, keyword classification — is novel in isolation. These are industry-standard tools. The differentiation is the specific architecture that wires them together for legal guidance: a secondary LLM call that *writes structured data back* to the user's profile after every turn (not just reads from it), a deterministic statute resolver that eliminates retrieval latency entirely, and a keyword classifier that avoids the cost and latency of LLM-based routing. This creates a feedback loop: conversation → fact extraction → profile enrichment → better next response. Each component is simple; the compounding interaction between them is what produces the response quality gap shown in the table above. The architecture pattern — continuous structured extraction from unstructured conversation — is analogous to a **write-ahead log with materialized views**, applied to the legal domain.

### Why Now

Three converging forces make this the optimal moment to build CaseMate:

1. **LLM capability threshold crossed.** Claude claude-sonnet-4-20250514 is the first model that reliably follows complex system prompts with injected structured data *and* produces consistently formatted legal citations. Models from 12 months ago hallucinated statute numbers too frequently to be trusted in a legal context.
2. **API cost inflection point.** Claude API costs have dropped ~70% in the past year. CaseMate's unit economics ($0.50/user/month) are only viable because of this cost curve — the same product built in 2024 would have had $3-5/user API costs, destroying the margin at $20/month.
3. **Regulatory window is open.** The ABA's 2025 resolution encouraging state bars to develop frameworks for AI-assisted legal services signals regulatory acceptance. Building now means establishing a user base and compliance track record before potential future regulation tightens. First movers who demonstrate responsible use will shape the rules.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Personalized legal chat** — Multi-turn conversations with persistent context
2. **Document analysis** — Upload leases, contracts, court notices for AI analysis
3. **Action generation** — Demand letters, rights summaries, and next-steps checklists
4. **Deadline tracking** — Auto-detected from conversations + manually created
5. **Know Your Rights library** — 19 pre-built legal guides across 10 domains
6. **Guided workflows** — 6 step-by-step legal process templates
7. **Attorney referrals** — State and specialty-based matching from a shared directory
8. **PDF export + email** — Generate branded PDFs and email them directly
9. **Conversation history** — Full CRUD on conversation threads
10. **Subscription management** — Stripe checkout, webhook handling, subscription lifecycle
11. **Waitlist system** — Email capture with Mailchimp sync and Supabase backup

## 2. Business Model

### Pricing

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0/mo | 5 questions/month, basic rights guides, no memory |
| **Personal** | $20/mo | Unlimited chat, full memory, document analysis, action generation, deadline tracking |
| **Family** | $35/mo | Everything in Personal for up to 4 family members, shared attorney referrals |

### Revenue Model

- **Subscription SaaS** — recurring monthly revenue via Stripe + RevenueCat
- **Target:** $10K MRR within 1-2 months of launch
- **Unit economics:** $20/mo per subscriber, ~$0.50/mo Claude API cost per active user (97.5% variable margin per user; excludes ~$70/mo fixed infrastructure)
- **LTV projection:** 12-month average retention at $20/mo = $240 LTV, CAC target < $30

### Customer Acquisition Strategy

| Channel | Target CAC | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| TikTok / Instagram Reels | $5-10 | Organic legal tips targeting viral cost-comparison content |
| SEO / Content Marketing | $8-15 | "Know your rights" guides ranking for long-tail legal queries |
| Attorney Referral Partnerships | $2-5 | Attorneys refer clients who need self-help, not full representation |
| Paid Social (Phase 2) | $15-25 | Retargeting waitlist visitors, lookalike audiences from converters |
| **Blended Target** | **< $30** | **8:1 LTV:CAC ratio ($240 LTV / $30 CAC)** |

### Conversion Funnel

| Stage | Target Rate |
|-------|------------|
| Landing page visit → Waitlist signup | 15% |
| Waitlist → Free trial activation | 40% |
| Free trial → Paid subscriber | 25% |
| Paid → Month 2 retention | 85% |

### Break-Even Analysis

| Cost Category | Monthly | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| Claude API | $0.50/user | 3 calls/turn × ~8 turns/user/month |
| Supabase | $25 flat (free tier → $25 pro) | Covers up to ~10K users |
| Railway (backend) | $5-20 | Scales with traffic |
| Vercel (web) | $0-20 | Free tier covers early growth |
| **Total fixed costs** | **~$70/mo** | At launch |
| **Variable cost/user** | **$0.50/mo** | Claude API only |
| **Revenue/user** | **$20/mo** | Personal tier |
| **Gross margin/user** | **$19.50 (97.5%)** | |
| **Break-even** | **4 paid subscribers** | Covers all fixed infrastructure |

At 50 subscribers ($1K MRR), profit is ~$905/mo after infrastructure. At 500 subscribers ($10K MRR), profit is ~$9,680/mo. The business is profitable from subscriber #4.

### Why This Works

The average legal consultation costs $349. A single CaseMate interaction that saves a user from a bad lease or calculates their security deposit damages pays for 17 months of subscription. The value is obvious from the first use.

## 4. Market & Competitive Landscape

### The Gap

| | Cost | Memory | State Laws | Action Generation |
|---|------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Traditional lawyer** | $349/hr | Yes (they remember you) | Yes | Yes (they draft letters) |
| **CaseMate** | $20/mo | Yes (persistent profile) | Yes (all 50 states) | Yes (letters, rights, checklists) |
| **LegalZoom** | $30-100/mo | No | Limited | Document templates only |
| **Rocket Lawyer** | $40/mo | No | Limited | Document drafts, no personalization |
| **DoNotPay** | $3/mo | No | No | Narrow scope (parking tickets, cancellations) |
| **ChatGPT** | Free/$20 | No | No | No legal specialization |
| **Legal Aid / LSC programs** | Free (if eligible) | Yes (case file) | Yes (local jurisdiction) | Manual (attorney-drafted) |

**Legal aid as a competitive substitute:** Legal Services Corporation-funded programs serve ~1.1 million of an estimated 60 million eligible Americans annually — a 98% unmet need rate. Eligibility is restricted to households below 125% of the federal poverty line ($19,500/individual). CaseMate targets the much larger "gap" population: earners who make too much for legal aid but too little for a $349/hour attorney. These segments are complementary — CaseMate's attorney referral feature routes users who qualify for free legal aid to their local LSC program rather than competing with it.

### Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)

| Level | Size | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| **TAM** | $15.6B | US legal services market for individuals (non-corporate) |
| **SAM** | $3.1B | Adults who searched for legal help online in the past year but couldn't afford a lawyer |
| **SOM** | $360M | 1% of the 130M underserved Americans at $20/mo (first 3 years) |

### CaseMate's Moat

No competitor combines **persistent memory** with **state-specific legal knowledge injection**. LegalZoom sells templates. Rocket Lawyer connects you to lawyers. DoNotPay automates narrow tasks. ChatGPT gives generic answers. CaseMate is the only product that gets smarter about *your specific situation* over time and applies *your state's actual statutes* to every answer.

**Three defensible advantages:**
1. **Compounding memory** — Every conversation makes CaseMate more useful. Switching costs increase over time as the profile deepens.
2. **50-state legal knowledge base** — Hand-built statute references for all 50 states across 10 legal domains. This took significant research effort and is not trivially replicable.
3. **Domain-specific prompt engineering** — The memory injection pattern, prompt injection defenses, and legal response formatting are tuned specifically for legal guidance. A general-purpose chatbot cannot replicate this without equivalent domain investment.

**Moat durability:** The 50-state knowledge base is a launch accelerant, not the primary moat. A well-funded competitor could replicate the statute dictionary in 3-6 months — but they cannot replicate user profiles. A CaseMate user with 30 extracted legal facts across 6 months of conversations has a personalized legal context that exists nowhere else. Switching to a competitor means starting from zero context. This is a data moat that deepens with every interaction and creates genuine switching costs. Additionally, the knowledge base requires continuous maintenance — statutes change, case law evolves, state bar opinions shift. CaseMate's early investment creates a maintenance cadence that compounds: by the time a competitor builds v1 of their statute dictionary, CaseMate is on v3 with real-world accuracy data from user citation feedback loops.

**"What stops Anthropic or OpenAI from building this?"** Three things: (1) **Incentive misalignment** — Anthropic and OpenAI sell API tokens; building a $20/mo vertical app competes with their own customers (us) and is worth less than the API revenue those customers generate. Google didn't build Salesforce; AWS didn't build Slack. Platform providers rarely build niche vertical apps. (2) **Domain expertise is the bottleneck, not AI capability** — the 50-state statute database, UPL compliance strategy, legal citation formatting, and domain-specific prompt engineering took Owen 8+ hours of legal research during the hackathon alone. A model provider would need a dedicated legal team to replicate this, and their marginal return on that investment is far lower than shipping the next foundation model. (3) **User data is non-replicable** — even if a competitor shipped an identical product tomorrow, CaseMate users with months of extracted legal facts would face a cold-start problem on any new platform. The moat is not the code — it's the accumulated structured profiles that make every response personal.

### Market Tailwinds

- **Access to justice crisis:** The ABA reports that 50% of US households face at least one legal issue per year, yet 80% of low-income Americans receive inadequate or no legal help. This is a recognized policy priority driving regulatory openness to legal tech solutions.
- **LLM cost decline:** Claude API costs have dropped ~70% in the past 12 months. CaseMate's unit economics improve with every price reduction — current cost per user is ~$0.50/mo and falling.
- **Regulatory environment:** AI legal information tools are explicitly permitted in most US jurisdictions. CaseMate provides legal *information*, not legal *advice*, operating clearly within the bounds of unauthorized practice of law (UPL) regulations. Our UPL compliance strategy includes: (1) every response carries a licensed-attorney disclaimer, (2) system prompts instruct the model to identify itself as non-attorney, (3) Terms of Service disclaim attorney-client privilege, and (4) post-launch, a quarterly advisory board review audits output patterns. See Section 24 for full risk assessment.
- **Consumer behavior shift:** Post-COVID, consumers expect digital-first access to professional services. Legal is one of the last major service categories to be disrupted by software.

## 5. Execution Plan & Roadmap

### Scope Definition: v1 Demo vs. Full Build

CaseMate has two clearly defined scopes — what ships at the hackathon and what the full product becomes:

| | **v1 Demo (Hackathon Deliverable)** | **Full Build (Post-Hackathon)** |
|---|------|------|
| **Screens** | 3 core screens: Chat + Profile Sidebar + Demand Letter Generator | 12 screens across web, mobile, and waitlist |
| **Backend** | Memory injection, profile CRUD, chat, action generation (~10 endpoints) | 33 endpoints covering deadlines, workflows, referrals, export, payments, streaming, monitoring |
| **Platforms** | Web (Next.js) | Web + iOS + Android (Expo) + standalone waitlist |
| **Tests** | Core memory layer coverage (~100 tests) | 484 tests across 34 files, 91%+ coverage |
| **State laws** | All 50 states (research completed in parallel by Owen) | All 50 states + federal defaults + ongoing statute updates |
| **Demo** | Sarah Chen profile → personalized chat → demand letter generation | Full user lifecycle: onboarding → chat → documents → actions → deadlines → export |

**The v1 demo proves the thesis.** Three screens are sufficient to demonstrate the before/after quality gap between a generic chatbot and memory-injected legal guidance. Everything beyond v1 is product depth, not proof of concept.

### Hackathon Build Phases (24-Hour Plan)

| Phase | Time | Tyler (Dev) | Owen (Product/GTM) | Deliverable | Verification Gate |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------| ------|
| 1. Foundation | Hour 0–1 | FastAPI scaffold, Supabase schema, health check | .env config, README, ARCHITECTURE.md | GET /health returns 200 | `curl /health` returns 200 |
| 2. Memory Layer | Hour 1–3 | LegalProfile model, injector.py, /api/chat | State law research for all 50 states | Memory injection end-to-end | Ask question as MA renter → response cites M.G.L. |
| 3. Onboarding | Hour 3–5 | POST /api/profile, intake wizard | UX copy, onboarding question design | Profile stored in Supabase | Complete wizard → profile visible in sidebar |
| 4. Auto-Updater | Hour 5–8 | updater.py, document pipeline, PDF extraction | 19 rights guides content, legal domain research | Facts auto-extracted | Mention new fact in chat → appears in profile |
| 5. Action Generators | Hour 8–12 | Letter/rights/checklist generators, PDF export | Demand letter templates, legal citation research | Demo-ready actions | Generate demand letter → PDF with citations |
| 6. UI Polish | Hour 12–18 | Profile sidebar, chat UI, mobile responsive | Content strategy, waitlist setup | All surfaces polished | Mobile responsive test at 375px width |
| 7. Hardening | Hour 18–24 | Full test suite, CI pipeline, demo seed data | MASTER_PROMPT, pitch prep, demo script | `make verify` passes | 0 failures in lint + test |

**Phases 1–5 deliver v1.** Phases 6–7 extend toward the full build. If time runs short at Hour 12, the 3-screen v1 demo is already complete and demo-ready.

### Why This Is Feasible in 24 Hours

Three force multipliers make this scope achievable for a 2-person team:

1. **Clear dev/GTM split** — Owen compiles the 50-state legal knowledge base (Hours 1–8) while Tyler codes. Neither person blocks the other. The knowledge base is pure research, not code — it can be produced in parallel.
2. **AI-assisted development** — Claude Code generates boilerplate, test scaffolding, and repetitive patterns (state law file structure, 10 area modules) at ~5x manual speed. Tests are auto-generated alongside each module, not a separate QA phase.
3. **Shared codebase architecture** — The Expo mobile app uses shared TypeScript types and API client from the web app. It is a thin native shell over the same backend, not a separate codebase. Three platforms (web, iOS, Android) from one set of types and one API.

### Post-Hackathon Roadmap

| Timeline | Milestone | Key Actions | Success Metric |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Week 1-2 | **App Store launch** | Expo EAS build → TestFlight → App Store review; Google Play internal testing → production | Both apps approved and live |
| Week 3-4 | **Payments live** | Stripe product/price creation, RevenueCat paywall integration, subscription lifecycle webhooks, receipt validation | First paying subscriber |
| Month 2 | **Growth to 1,000 users** | Scale TikTok/Instagram content to daily posts, launch paid social ads ($500/mo budget), SEO blog with legal guides | 1,000 registered users, $1K MRR |
| Month 3 | **Family plan + partnerships** | Multi-profile family tier, attorney directory partnerships (10 firms), referral revenue share program | Family plan subscribers, 10 attorney partners |
| Month 4-6 | **Scale to $10K MRR** | Expand legal domains to 15+, add immigration and criminal records depth, launch email drip campaigns, A/B test pricing | $10K MRR, 500+ paid subscribers |
| Month 6-12 | **Developer platform** | Public API for profile reads (user-consented), webhook events (new_fact_extracted, deadline_approaching), embeddable chat widget for attorney websites | 10 API integrations, 5 attorney embed partners |

### Ecosystem & Extensibility Vision

CaseMate's long-term defensibility depends on becoming infrastructure, not just an app. The structured legal profile is a platform primitive:

| Extension Point | Description | Business Model |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Embeddable chat widget** | Attorneys embed CaseMate on their websites. Users get free triage; attorneys get pre-qualified leads with structured intake data | Revenue share per qualified referral |
| **Webhook API** | `new_fact_extracted`, `deadline_approaching`, `issue_status_changed` events notify external systems | API tier pricing |
| **Profile read API** | User-consented read access to structured legal profiles for practice management software (Clio, MyCase) | Per-read API fee |
| **Legal aid intake integration** | Route eligible users to LSC-funded legal aid programs with pre-populated intake forms | Free (public good + brand) |
| **White-label API** | Other legal tech products use CaseMate's memory injection engine under their own brand | SaaS licensing |

**Interoperability design:** All API responses follow JSON:API conventions. Webhook payloads are versioned (`v1/events`). The profile schema is documented as a public specification so third-party developers can build against a stable contract. OAuth 2.0 scopes control which profile fields a third-party integration can access (e.g., `profile:read:state` vs `profile:read:legal_facts`).

### Key Metrics We Track

| Metric | Tool | Target (Month 3) |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| MRR | Stripe Dashboard | $3,000 |
| Subscriber count | RevenueCat | 150 paid |
| Churn rate | RevenueCat | < 15% monthly |
| Conversations per user/month | Supabase query | 8+ |
| Profile completeness | Supabase query | 70% of users have 5+ legal facts |
| Waitlist → Paid conversion | Google Analytics + Stripe | 10% |

---

## 6. Architecture

### Data Flow

User (Web/Mobile) → Supabase Auth (JWT) → FastAPI Backend → Claude API (Anthropic) + Supabase DB (Postgres) + Redis (Rate Limiting)

### Request Lifecycle (Chat)

| Step | Operation | Latency |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | JWT verified via `verify_supabase_jwt()` | <1ms |
| 2 | Rate limit checked (10 req/min for chat) | 1-5ms |
| 3 | User profile loaded from Supabase | 10-50ms |
| 4 | Legal area classified via keyword matcher | <1ms |
| 5 | System prompt built: base instructions + profile JSON + active issues + state laws | <1ms |
| 6 | Conversation history loaded (last 20 messages) | 10-50ms |
| 7 | Claude API called via retry_anthropic (3 attempts, exponential backoff) | 2-5s |
| 8 | Response returned to user | — |
| 9 | **Background tasks (concurrent, non-blocking):** save_conversation, update_profile (extract new legal facts), detect_and_save_deadlines | 3-6s each |

### Background Task System

Three tasks run after every chat turn via FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`:

| Task | Module | Purpose |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `save_conversation` | `memory/conversation_store.py` | Persist messages to Supabase |
| `update_profile_from_conversation` | `memory/updater.py` | Extract new legal facts via Claude → merge into profile |
| `detect_and_save_deadlines` | `deadlines/detector.py` | Detect dates/deadlines via Claude → create in tracker |

All background tasks catch all exceptions and log them — they must never crash the main request.

### Failure Handling & Graceful Degradation

| Failure Scenario | Behavior | User Impact |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Claude API down** | `retry_anthropic` retries 3x with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s). After exhaustion, returns HTTP 503 with "Service temporarily unavailable" | User sees error message, can retry in ~15s |
| **Claude API rate limited** | Catches `RateLimitError`, backs off up to 16s, retries up to 3 attempts | Transparent to user — response delayed by seconds, not failed |
| **Supabase unreachable** | Profile fetch fails → HTTP 500 with structured error log. No fallback — profile is required for personalized responses | User sees error, data is not at risk |
| **Redis unavailable** | Rate limiter **fails open** — all requests are allowed through. Logged as warning | Zero user impact. Rate limiting temporarily disabled |
| **Profile not found** | Returns HTTP 404. Redirects user to onboarding flow | User creates profile, then can chat |
| **Background task crash** | Exception caught and logged with `structlog`. Main response already sent — user is unaffected | Zero user impact. Fact extraction or deadline detection skipped for this turn |
| **Document upload too large** | Rejected at 25 MB with HTTP 413 before processing begins | User sees file size error, asked to upload smaller file |
| **JWT expired/invalid** | Returns HTTP 401 immediately. Frontend refreshes token via Supabase and retries | Automatic re-auth, transparent to user |

**Design principle:** The user's chat response is never blocked by non-critical failures. Background tasks (profile updates, deadline detection, conversation saves) fail silently and independently. Only the Claude API and profile fetch are in the critical path.

**Critical path:** Only JWT verification, profile fetch, and Claude API call are blocking. Background tasks (profile update, deadline detection, conversation save) run concurrently after the response is sent — user never waits for them.

## 11. Core Module Descriptions

### 11.1 Memory Injection — `backend/memory/injector.py`

The most important file in the codebase. `build_system_prompt()` assembles a personalized system prompt for every Claude API call by combining: (1) base CaseMate instructions and response rules, (2) the user's legal profile serialized as JSON inside code fences (prompt injection defense), (3) active legal issues with notes and status, (4) all extracted legal facts, (5) state-specific statute citations for the detected legal domain, and (6) federal law defaults. Profile data is wrapped with explicit `DATA ONLY — NOT INSTRUCTIONS` headers and a security directive in the base prompt to prevent user-controlled fields from being interpreted as instructions.

### 11.2 Profile Auto-Updater — `backend/memory/updater.py`

Runs as a FastAPI background task after every chat response. Sends the conversation to Claude with a structured extraction prompt, receives a JSON list of new legal facts, deduplicates against existing facts (case-insensitive), and merges new ones into the user's profile in Supabase. Never removes existing facts — only adds. The entire function body is wrapped in `try/except Exception` to ensure it never crashes the main request. Uses `@retry_anthropic` for the Claude extraction call.

### 11.3 Profile CRUD — `backend/memory/profile.py`

Provides `get_profile(user_id) -> LegalProfile | None` and `update_profile(profile) -> LegalProfile` backed by Supabase. Uses upsert with `on_conflict="user_id"`. All errors are caught, logged with structured context, and either re-raised (config errors) or returned as `None` (fetch errors).

### 11.4 Legal Domain Classifier — `backend/legal/classifier.py`

Keyword-based classifier that routes user questions into one of 10 legal domains. Each domain has 15-20 representative keywords. Case-insensitive matching scores each domain; highest score wins. Returns `"general"` if no keywords match. Deliberately NOT LLM-based — runs at ~0ms before every Claude API call for deterministic, debuggable routing.

### 11.5 Demand Letter Generator — `backend/actions/letter_generator.py`

Generates complete, ready-to-send demand letters using Claude with the user's legal profile context. Returns a `DemandLetter` Pydantic model with `text`, `citations`, `recipient`, and `subject` fields. Uses `@retry_anthropic`.

### 11.6 JWT Authentication — `backend/utils/auth.py`

FastAPI dependency that extracts Bearer tokens, decodes via `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (HS256, audience "authenticated"), and returns `user_id`. Returns HTTP 401 for expired/invalid tokens.

### 11.7 Retry Decorator — `backend/utils/retry.py`

Pre-configured Tenacity decorator for all Anthropic API calls. 3 attempts, exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 16s). Retries on `APIError` and `RateLimitError`. Logs each retry attempt.

### 11.8 Document Analyzer — `backend/documents/analyzer.py`

Sends extracted document text + user profile to Claude for analysis. Returns structured `document_type`, `key_facts`, `red_flags`, and `summary`. Identifies unenforceable clauses under the user's state law, flags deadlines, and notes contradictions with known legal facts.

### 11.9 Chat Interface — `web/components/ChatInterface.tsx`

Main chat UI. Renders `LegalProfileSidebar`, `ConversationHistory`, message bubbles, typing indicator, `ActionGenerator`, and input. Dark theme with glassmorphism styling.

### 11.10 Waitlist System — `web/components/WaitlistForm.tsx` + `web/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`

Email capture form + server-side API route. Dual write: Mailchimp primary (with tags), Supabase backup. Both integrations are optional — the route succeeds even if env vars are missing.

## 12. Legal Domain System

### 10 Domains

| Domain Key | Label | Keyword Examples |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| `landlord_tenant` | Landlord & Tenant | landlord, tenant, rent, lease, eviction, security deposit, habitability |
| `employment_rights` | Employment Rights | employer, fired, discrimination, harassment, wage, overtime, fmla |
| `consumer_protection` | Consumer Protection | scam, fraud, refund, warranty, lemon law, false advertising |
| `debt_collections` | Debt & Collections | debt collector, garnishment, fdcpa, credit report, repossession |
| `small_claims` | Small Claims Court | small claims, sue, lawsuit, damages, judgment, mediation |
| `contract_disputes` | Contract Disputes | contract, breach, non-compete, nda, indemnification |
| `traffic_violations` | Traffic & Driving | traffic ticket, speeding, dui, license suspended, reckless driving |
| `family_law` | Family Law | divorce, custody, child support, alimony, restraining order |
| `criminal_records` | Criminal Records | expungement, felony, misdemeanor, background check, parole |
| `immigration` | Immigration | visa, green card, citizenship, deportation, asylum, daca |
| `general` | General | (fallback when no keywords match) |

### Legal Areas Directory — `backend/legal/areas/`

Each domain has its own module with domain-specific logic:

| File | Domain |
| ---- | ------ |
| `landlord_tenant.py` | Landlord & Tenant |
| `employment.py` | Employment Rights |
| `consumer.py` | Consumer Protection |
| `debt_collections.py` | Debt & Collections |
| `small_claims.py` | Small Claims Court |
| `contracts.py` | Contract Disputes |
| `traffic.py` | Traffic & Driving |
| `family_law.py` | Family Law |
| `criminal_records.py` | Criminal Records |
| `immigration.py` | Immigration |

### 50-State Law Structure

All 50 states plus federal defaults, organized by geographic region:

**Northeast (9):** CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT
**Southeast (14):** AL, AR, DE, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, NC, SC, TN, VA, WV
**Midwest (12):** IA, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, SD, WI
**South Central (2):** OK, TX
**West (13):** AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NM, NV, OR, UT, WA, WY

Each state entry maps domain keys to concise law descriptions with real statute citations (e.g., MA → landlord_tenant → "MA Gen. Laws ch. 186 §15B: Security deposit..."). Up to 10 domains per state. The `federal_defaults` key provides baseline federal law citations (FDCPA, FLSA, Title VII, etc.) that apply in all states.

### Workflow Templates — `backend/workflows/templates/definitions.py`

6 pre-built step-by-step guided workflows:

| Template ID | Title | Domain | Estimated Time | Steps |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | -------------- | ----- |
| `fight_eviction` | Fight an Eviction | landlord_tenant | 2-6 weeks | 7 |
| `file_small_claims` | File a Small Claims Case | small_claims | 4-8 weeks | 5 |
| `expunge_record` | Get a Record Expunged | criminal_records | 2-6 months | 6 |
| `file_wage_complaint` | File a Wage Complaint | employment_rights | 2-6 months | 4 |
| `fight_traffic_ticket` | Fight a Traffic Ticket | traffic_violations | 2-6 weeks | 4 |
| `create_basic_will` | Create a Basic Will | family_law | 1-2 weeks | 5 |

---

## 13. Core Data Models

### Python (Pydantic v2)

All models use strict Pydantic v2 `BaseModel` with full type annotations (no `Any`). Key models:

| Model | Module | Key Fields | Purpose |

| `LegalIssue` | `models/legal_profile.py` | issue_type, summary, status (open/resolved/watching/escalated), notes[] | Tracked legal disputes |
| `Message` | `models/conversation.py` | role (user/assistant/error), content, timestamp, legal_area | Single chat message |
| `Conversation` | `models/conversation.py` | id, user_id, messages[], legal_area, created_at, updated_at | Full conversation thread |

| `Deadline` | `deadlines/tracker.py` | id, user_id, title, date, legal_area, status, source_conversation_id | Auto-detected or manual deadlines |
| `WorkflowTemplate` / `WorkflowInstance` | `workflows/engine.py` | id, title, domain, steps[], current_step, status | Guided legal process templates |
| `Attorney` / `ReferralSuggestion` | `referrals/matcher.py` | name, state, specializations[], rating, match_reason, relevance_score | Attorney matching |
| `RightsGuide` | `knowledge/rights_library.py` | domain, title, your_rights[], action_steps[], common_mistakes[] | Pre-built legal guides |

### TypeScript (Shared Interfaces)

Located in `shared/types/` and re-exported via `mobile/lib/types.ts`. Mirror the Python models 1:1 for type-safe frontend ↔ backend communication. Covers: `legal-profile.ts`, `conversation.ts`, `actions.ts`, `deadlines.ts`, `rights.ts`, `workflows.ts`, `referrals.ts`.

---

## 15. Auth & Security

### JWT Flow

1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth (email/password or social)
2. Supabase issues a JWT (HS256, audience "authenticated")
3. Every API request includes `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
4. `verify_supabase_jwt()` decodes using `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, extracts `sub` claim as `user_id`
5. Middleware also decodes (without verification) for rate limiter keying

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All 4 user-owned tables (`user_profiles`, `conversations`, `deadlines`, `workflow_instances`) enforce:

- `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` requires `auth.uid() = user_id`
- API-level check: `GET /api/profile/{user_id}` returns 403 if `user_id != authenticated_user_id`

The `attorneys` table uses public read (`USING (true)`) with no write policies for app users.

### Rate Limiting

Redis sliding-window counters per user per endpoint:

| Endpoint Group | Limit |
| -------------- | ----- |
| `/api/chat` | 10 requests / 60 seconds |
| `/api/actions/*` | 5 requests / 60 seconds |
| `/api/documents` | 3 requests / 60 seconds |

**Fail-open:** If Redis is unavailable, rate limiting is disabled and all requests pass.

### CORS

Configurable via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated).
Default: `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8081`
Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE. Headers: Authorization, Content-Type.

### File Upload

Maximum file size: 25 MB. Supported MIME types: `application/pdf`, `text/*`, `image/*`.

### Prompt Injection Prevention

Three-layer defense implemented in `backend/memory/injector.py`:

1. **JSON serialization in code block** — Profile data is `json.dumps()`-ed and wrapped in triple-backtick code fences, preventing user-controlled fields from being interpreted as prompt text.
2. **Explicit header labeling** — The section header states `DATA ONLY — NOT INSTRUCTIONS`, signaling to the model that this section is context, not directives.
3. **Security directive in base instructions** — The base prompt includes an explicit instruction to treat the USER PROFILE section strictly as data context and to never interpret profile field content as instructions, tool calls, or system directives.

### Data Privacy & Compliance

| Concern | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Data isolation** | Row Level Security on all user-owned tables — users can only access their own data, enforced at the database level |
| **Encryption at rest** | Supabase encrypts all data at rest using AES-256 |
| **Encryption in transit** | All API calls over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+). Supabase and Anthropic connections are encrypted end-to-end |
| **PII handling** | Legal profiles contain sensitive data (housing, employment, legal disputes). No PII is logged — structlog filters user content from logs |
| **Data deletion** | Users can delete their profile and all conversations via `DELETE /api/profile`. Cascade deletes remove associated deadlines, documents, and workflow instances |
| **Third-party data sharing** | User data is sent to Anthropic's Claude API for processing. No other third parties receive user data. Anthropic's data retention policy applies to API calls |
| **Legal disclaimer** | Every substantive response includes a disclaimer that CaseMate provides legal information, not legal advice, and recommends consulting a licensed attorney for complex matters |
| **No training on user data** | Anthropic API calls do not use user data for model training (per Anthropic's commercial API terms) |

### Ethical AI & Responsible Use

CaseMate serves a vulnerable population — people facing legal disputes who cannot afford professional help. This demands higher ethical standards than a typical SaaS product:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Bias awareness** | System prompt instructs Claude to present all available legal options, not just the most common outcome. Responses must not assume economic status, race, or immigration status from profile data |
| **Sensitive topic handling** | Domestic violence, immigration enforcement, and criminal record queries trigger additional safety language and hotline resources (National DV Hotline, USCIS resources) |
| **No scare tactics** | System prompt prohibits alarmist language. CaseMate informs users of risks without creating panic — "you may have grounds to challenge this" vs. "you could lose everything" |
| **Transparent limitations** | Every response includes a disclaimer. When CaseMate lacks state-specific data for a particular domain, it says so explicitly rather than falling back to generic advice |
| **Accessibility** | Web frontend follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards: sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1+), keyboard navigation support, semantic HTML for screen readers, responsive design tested down to 320px width |
| **Multilingual roadmap** | Post-launch priority: Spanish language support (serving 41M+ native Spanish speakers in the US who face disproportionate barriers to legal access) |

## 16. Frontend Patterns

### Web (Next.js)

- **Dark theme** with Tailwind CSS
- **API proxy:** `next.config.mjs` rewrites `/api/*` to the backend URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
- **Supabase client:** initialized with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`
- **Error handling:** `ErrorBoundary` component, `Skeleton` loading component
- **Root page** (`web/app/page.tsx`): server redirect to `/auth` — the waitlist landing page is in `waitlist/app/page.tsx`

### Mobile (Expo React Native)

- **Navigation:** Expo Router with file-based routing
- **Tab layout:** 5 visible tabs + 7 hidden stack screens

| Tab | Screen |
| --- | ------ |
| Chat | `chat.tsx` -- Main AI chat interface |
| Cases | `cases.tsx` -- User's legal cases |
| Tools | `tools.tsx` -- Legal tools hub |
| Deadlines | `deadlines.tsx` -- Deadline tracker |
| Profile | `profile.tsx` -- User profile management |

Hidden screens (accessible via navigation, not tabs): `rights`, `rights-guide`, `workflows`, `workflow-wizard`, `attorneys`, `conversations`, `documents`

- **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Auth guard:** `_layout.tsx` checks Supabase session, redirects to `/(auth)/login` if missing
- **API client** (`mobile/lib/api.ts`):
  - Wraps all API calls with auth headers from Supabase session
  - `fetchWithRetry()`: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Does not retry 4xx errors (only 5xx and network failures)
  - Type-safe with generics: `request<T>(path, options): Promise<T>`
- **Theme:** Blue primary (`#1e40af`), slate gray secondary, white backgrounds

---

## 17. Testing

### Test Infrastructure

- **Framework:** pytest with `pytest-asyncio` (auto mode)
- **Coverage:** `pytest-cov` with term-missing report
- **34 backend test files** + **20 frontend test files** covering all modules
- **484 backend tests**, 100% pass rate, **91%+ line coverage**
- All tests run without real API calls or database connections
- **Coverage target:** 90%+ line coverage on core modules (memory/, legal/, actions/)
- **CI integration:** `make verify` runs `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` + full test suite before every commit
- **Zero-tolerance policy:** No commit is allowed with failing tests. Pre-commit hook enforces `make verify`

### Shared Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`)

Four shared fixtures: `mock_profile` (Sarah Chen power-user profile with 8 facts, active issues, 12 conversations), `mock_anthropic` (patched AsyncAnthropic client), `mock_supabase` (patched Supabase client with chainable queries), and `mock_anthropic_response` (factory for shaped mock responses).

### Mock Strategy

All tests run without real API calls or database connections. Anthropic is patched at the client level; Supabase is patched at the singleton getter. No external dependencies required to run the full test suite.

### Backend Test Files (34 files, 484 tests)

| File | Tests |
| ---- | ----- |
| `test_memory_injector.py` | System prompt construction, profile injection, state law inclusion |
| `test_profile_crud.py` | Profile CRUD operations (get, update, upsert) |
| `test_profile_updater.py` | Background fact extraction |
| `test_conversation_store.py` | Conversation CRUD |

Backend: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` → `make dev` (uvicorn on :8000). Web: `cd web && npm install && npm run dev` (Next.js on :3000). Mobile: `cd mobile && npm install && npx expo start` (Expo on :8081).

### Makefile Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `make dev` | Start backend with hot reload on port 8000 |
| `make backend` | Start FastAPI backend only |
| `make frontend` | Start Next.js frontend only on port 3000 |
| `make install` | Install Python + Node dependencies |

## 19. Code Standards & Patterns

### Docstrings
Every class and public method has a full docstring with Args/Returns/Raises. Module-level docstrings explain the file's purpose in the system.

### Type Annotations
Every function has full type annotations. No `Any`, no missing return types. Union syntax (`str | None`), not `Optional[str]`.

### Logging
Structured logging via structlog -- JSON in production, console in development. All modules use `get_logger(__name__)`. Always include `user_id` context. Never bare `print()`. Log levels: `info` for normal operations, `warning` for recoverable issues, `error` for failures.

### Error Handling
- No bare `except` -- catch specific exceptions
- Log with context (`error_type`, `error_message`, `user_id`)
- Background tasks wrap entire body in `try/except Exception` -- never crash the main request
- HTTP errors use structured `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes (401, 403, 404, 429)

### Retry
All Anthropic API calls use `@retry_anthropic`: 3 attempts, exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 16s). Retries on `APIError` and `RateLimitError`. Logs each retry. Re-raises after exhaustion.

### Linting
Ruff with rules: E, F, I, N, W, UP, B, SIM, ANN. Target Python 3.12, line length 100.

### Commits
Format: `feat(scope): description`, `fix(scope): description`, `test(scope): description`, `docs(scope): description`, `chore: description`. Run `make verify` before every commit.

## 20. Demo & Seed Data

### Sarah Chen Demo Profile

The demo profile used for presentations and testing:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | Sarah Chen |
| **State** | Massachusetts |
| **Housing** | Renter, month-to-month, no signed lease |
| **Employment** | Full-time W2, marketing coordinator |
| **Family** | Single, no dependents |
| **Active Issue** | Landlord claiming $800 for bathroom tile damage |
| **Legal Facts (8)** | No move-in inspection, pre-existing water damage in photos, written 30-day notice (Feb 28), no signed lease, deposit not returned within 30 days, mold reported Nov 2025, landlord entered without 24hr notice (Jan 15), Venmo rent payment records |
| **Documents** | lease_2024.pdf, move_out_notice.png, bathroom_photos.zip |
| **Member Since** | January 15, 2026 |
| **Conversations** | 12 |

### Demo Script (2 minutes 45 seconds)

1. Open CaseMate — Sarah's profile is visible in the sidebar
2. Type: "My landlord is saying I owe $800 for the bathroom tiles"
3. CaseMate responds citing M.G.L. c.186 §15B, referencing the missing inspection, calculating Sarah may be owed her deposit PLUS up to 3x damages
4. Click "Generate demand letter"
5. Letter appears — pre-filled, cited, ready to send
6. Closing: "A lawyer would have charged $700 for that consultation. CaseMate costs $20 a month. That is the gap we are closing."

## 21. Design Tradeoffs

| Decision | Choice | Alternative | Why |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | --- |
| Legal area classifier | Keyword matching | LLM-based classification | Speed + determinism. Runs on every message before the Claude API call. ~0ms vs ~2s latency. Accuracy is sufficient for routing to the correct state law section. |
| Data storage | Supabase structured tables | Vector DB / RAG | Profile data is structured (state, facts, issues), not unstructured text. No semantic search needed — exact field lookups are sufficient. Avoids embedding pipeline complexity. |
| Backend framework | FastAPI (Python) | Next.js API routes | Background tasks (profile updater, deadline detector) need `BackgroundTasks`. SSE streaming for future chat streaming. Python for Claude SDK ergonomics. |
| Rate limiting | Redis fail-open | Redis fail-closed | Availability over strictness. If Redis is down, users should still be able to ask legal questions. Rate limiting is a protection layer, not a core feature. |
| Profile updates | Background task | Synchronous in request | Never blocks the user's response. The profile update takes 2-5s (additional Claude call). Users get their answer immediately; memory compounds silently. |
| State law coverage | All 50 states | Top 5 states only | Broader coverage at launch means any US user gets personalized answers. Federal defaults fill gaps for less-populated states. |

---

## 22. Performance & Scalability

### Latency Profile

| Operation | Expected Latency | Notes |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| JWT verification | <1ms | Local HS256 decode |
| Rate limit check | 1-5ms | Redis INCR + EXPIRE |
| Profile fetch | 10-50ms | Supabase SELECT by PK |
| Legal area classification | <1ms | In-memory keyword matching |
| Claude API call (chat) | 2-5s | Main response generation |
| Claude API call (profile update) | 2-5s | Background task, non-blocking |
| Claude API call (deadline detection) | 2-5s | Background task, non-blocking |

### Background Task Strategy

Three tasks fire after every chat turn via FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`:

1. **save_conversation** — Write messages to Supabase (~50ms)
2. **update_profile_from_conversation** — Claude extraction + Supabase write (~3-6s)
3. **detect_and_save_deadlines** — Claude detection + Supabase write (~3-6s)

All three run concurrently after the response is sent. Total user-perceived latency is only the main Claude API call (2-5s).

### Rate Limiting Strategy

Redis sliding-window counters keyed by `{user_id}:{endpoint_group}`:

| Endpoint Group | Limit | Window |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ |
| `/api/chat` | 10 requests | 60 seconds |
| `/api/actions/*` | 5 requests | 60 seconds |
| `/api/documents` | 3 requests | 60 seconds |

429 responses include `Retry-After` header with remaining cooldown seconds.

### Database Indexing

All tables indexed for common query patterns: `user_id` on every user-owned table, composite indexes for sorted queries (`user_id + updated_at DESC`, `user_id + date ASC`, `user_id + status`), GIN index on `attorneys.specializations` for JSONB array search, and `state + rating DESC` for ranked attorney lookup.

### Scaling Projections

| Users | DB Storage | Claude API Cost/mo | Infrastructure Cost/mo |
|-------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 100 | ~50 MB | ~$50 | ~$25 (Railway hobby) |
| 1,000 | ~500 MB | ~$500 | ~$50 (Railway pro) |
| 10,000 | ~5 GB | ~$5,000 | ~$200 (Railway pro + Redis) |
| 100,000 | ~50 GB | ~$50,000 | ~$500 (dedicated infra) |

At 10,000 users with $200K MRR ($20/mo each), infrastructure costs are < 3% of revenue. The business scales efficiently because the primary cost (Claude API) is proportional to usage, not fixed.

### API Throughput at Scale

At 1,000 concurrent users, each chat turn generates up to 3 Claude API calls (1 user-facing + 2 background). Peak load: 3,000 concurrent requests to Anthropic's API.

**Tiered model routing (designed, deployment-ready):**

| Call Type | Model | Latency | Cost/call | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| User-facing chat | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | 2-5s | ~$0.015 | Quality-critical — user sees this |
| Profile extraction | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 | 0.5-1s | ~$0.002 | Structured JSON extraction |
| Deadline detection | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 | 0.5-1s | ~$0.002 | Date pattern matching |

This reduces background API load by ~80% and per-turn cost from ~$0.045 to ~$0.019.

**Throughput controls:**
- **Async semaphore:** Background tasks share a semaphore (max 50 concurrent Claude calls). User-facing calls bypass the semaphore — background tasks yield under contention.
- **Prompt caching:** Anthropic prompt caching stores the static system prompt prefix (~2,000 tokens of base instructions + state law). At 1,000 users, this eliminates ~2M redundant input tokens/day.
- **Graceful degradation:** If background queue depth exceeds 500, profile updates batch every 5 minutes instead of per-turn. Users still get immediate responses; memory updates lag slightly.

### Caching Strategy

- **Profile caching:** User profiles are fetched once per request. At scale, a Redis cache with 5-minute TTL would reduce Supabase reads by ~80%.
- **State law caching:** All state law data is loaded in-memory at startup. Zero database reads for legal context lookup.
- **Classifier caching:** Legal area classification is pure in-memory keyword matching — no external calls.
- **Conversation history:** Loaded from Supabase per request. At scale, recent conversations could be cached in Redis with write-through invalidation.

### Horizontal Scaling & Connection Pooling

- **FastAPI horizontal scaling:** The backend is stateless — all session state lives in Supabase, all caching in Redis. Scaling is a `replicas: N` change in Railway/Docker Compose with a load balancer (Railway's built-in or nginx) distributing requests round-robin. No sticky sessions required because every request reconstructs context from the database.
- **Supabase connection pooling:** Supabase includes PgBouncer in transaction mode by default (port 6543). At 1,000+ concurrent users, direct connections would exhaust PostgreSQL's default 100-connection limit. All production queries route through the pooler endpoint, supporting 1,000+ concurrent application connections mapped to ~20 actual database connections. The `supabase-py` client uses the pooler URL automatically when configured via `SUPABASE_URL`.
- **Redis connection pooling:** The `redis-py` client uses a connection pool (default 10 connections, configurable). At scale, Redis Cluster with 3 shards handles rate limiting and profile caching independently — rate limit keys shard by user_id, cache keys shard by profile_id.

## 24. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### A. Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) — The Existential Risk

The line between legal *information* and legal *advice* is the single most important regulatory boundary for CaseMate. Crossing it could expose the company to state bar enforcement actions.

**Current safeguards:**
- CaseMate provides legal *information*, not legal *advice* — this distinction is legally significant and recognized by courts in all 50 states
- Every response includes a disclaimer recommending a licensed attorney for complex matters
- System prompt explicitly instructs Claude: "You are NOT a licensed attorney and you make that clear when relevant"
- State-by-state UPL research confirms most jurisdictions permit AI-generated legal information (not advice)
- Terms of Service explicitly disclaim any attorney-client relationship

**Post-launch safeguards:**
- Retain a legal advisory board attorney to review output patterns quarterly
- Pursue ABA Innovation Sandbox participation for regulatory safe harbor
- Monitor state bar opinions on AI legal tools and update system prompts accordingly
- Implement automated flagging for responses that approach advice territory (e.g., "you should sue" vs. "you may have grounds to pursue a claim")

**Named legal advisor:** Tyler has engaged a practicing Massachusetts attorney (bar-admitted, consumer protection focus) as CaseMate's first advisory board member. This attorney has reviewed the system prompt, response formatting, and disclaimer language, and has provided a letter of intent to serve as quarterly output auditor post-launch. This relationship strengthens the regulatory story: CaseMate is not operating in a legal vacuum — it has active attorney oversight from day one.

**State-specific UPL enforcement risk:** UPL enforcement varies significantly by state. Florida, Texas, and New York have the most aggressive unauthorized practice enforcement histories. CaseMate mitigates this with three state-aware controls: (1) the system prompt dynamically adjusts disclaimer specificity based on user state — stricter-enforcement states receive more prominent attorney referral language; (2) responses in high-enforcement states never use imperative phrasing ("you should file") and always use informational framing ("in [state], the process for filing is..."); (3) the attorney referral feature is prioritized in states where the bar has published opinions restricting AI legal tools, routing users to local attorneys rather than attempting to self-serve complex matters.

### B. AI Hallucination & Incorrect Legal Citations

Incorrect legal citations in a legal assistant are not just unhelpful — they are potentially harmful. CaseMate uses a three-layer grounding strategy to minimize hallucination risk:

**Architecture-level mitigations:**
1. **State law dictionaries** (`backend/legal/states/`) provide real statutes injected directly into the system prompt — Claude cites from provided context, not from training data
2. **Keyword classifier** routes to the correct legal domain *before* the Claude call, ensuring only relevant statutes are in context
3. **Static rights guides** (`backend/knowledge/rights_library.py`) provide pre-verified legal information that Claude can reference directly
4. **Response rules** in system prompt enforce citation discipline: "Cite the relevant statute for their state when it exists. Real citation (e.g. M.G.L. c.186 §15B), not vague references."

**Post-launch mitigations:**
- Sampling-based audit of 5% of responses weekly, flagging any citation not present in the state law dictionary
- User feedback mechanism: "Was this citation helpful?" to surface hallucinated references
- Automated citation extraction and cross-reference against the statute database

### C. API Cost Overruns at Scale

CaseMate makes up to three Claude API calls per chat turn (response + profile update + deadline detection). Uncontrolled scaling could erode margins.

**Current controls:**
- Unit economics: ~$0.50/user/month at claude-sonnet-4-20250514 pricing (96% gross margin at $20/mo)
- Rate limiting: 10 chat requests/min per user prevents abuse
- Cost scaling is linear and predictable (see Section 22 projections)

**Planned controls:**
- **Circuit breaker:** If monthly API spend exceeds 2x projected, alert and throttle background tasks first (profile updates and deadline detection are non-blocking)
- **Model routing:** Use claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 for profile extraction and deadline detection — 80% cost reduction on background tasks while maintaining quality for user-facing responses
- **Prompt caching:** Anthropic's prompt caching reduces cost for the static portions of the system prompt (base instructions + state law context) by up to 90%
- Monthly cost monitoring dashboard with automated Slack alerts at 75%, 100%, and 150% of projected spend

### D. User Data Loss or Corruption

- Supabase provides automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- All profile updates are append-only for legal facts — the updater never removes existing facts, only adds
- Conversation saves use Supabase upsert with conflict resolution on conversation ID
- RLS policies prevent cross-user data access at the database level — even a compromised JWT for user A cannot read user B's data

### E. Competitive Response (ChatGPT / Google Adds Legal Features)

- CaseMate's moat is *compounding memory* — even if a competitor adds legal features, they start with zero user context. A CaseMate user with 6 months of conversation history and 30 extracted legal facts gets dramatically better responses than a new user on any platform
- 50-state legal knowledge base is a research investment not trivially replicated by prompting alone
- Domain-specific prompt engineering (injection defenses, citation formatting, response rules) represents months of tuning that a general-purpose chatbot team would need to replicate
- First-mover advantage in the legal AI information space builds brand trust — users need to *trust* their legal assistant, and switching costs increase as the profile deepens

### F. Hackathon Contingency Plans

| Risk | Trigger | Contingency |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Claude API goes down during build** | API returns 5xx for >10 min | Switch to mock responses for UI development. Resume live integration when API recovers. Pre-built Sarah Chen demo response ensures the demo works offline. |
| **Supabase schema migration fails** | Migration SQL errors | Fall back to direct SQL via Supabase dashboard. Schema is documented in Section 9 — can be recreated manually in <15 min. |
| **Mobile app won't build** | Expo build errors | Deprioritize mobile. Web app is the primary demo surface. Mobile is bonus credit, not the core deliverable. |
| **Memory injection produces generic responses** | Demo response doesn't cite state law | Debug injector.py first (most important file). If state law dict is incomplete, hard-code MA laws for demo and expand post-hackathon. |
| **Tests fail and block commit** | `make verify` fails | Fix critical test failures only. Disable non-blocking tests temporarily. Never ship with zero tests — minimum 50 covering memory layer. |
| **Time crunch: behind schedule at Hour 12** | Less than 5 phases complete | Cut to v1 scope: chat + profile sidebar + demand letter. These 3 screens prove the thesis and are the complete v1 demo. |

## 25. Monitoring, Observability & Quality Assurance

### Production Monitoring

| Signal | Tool | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| API uptime | Railway health checks + UptimeRobot | < 99.5% triggers page |
| Response latency (P95) | structlog + Railway metrics | > 8s (main chat endpoint) |
| Error rate | structlog error count / total requests | > 2% in 5-minute window |
| Claude API errors | structlog `anthropic_error` events | > 5 in 10 minutes |
| Background task failures | structlog `background_task_error` events | > 10% failure rate |
| Rate limit hits (429s) | Redis counter + structlog | Informational — tracks abuse patterns |

### Response Quality Metrics

Measuring whether memory injection actually produces better responses is critical to proving the core thesis:

| Metric | How Measured | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Citation accuracy** | Weekly sample audit: do cited statutes exist in state law dictionary? | > 95% of citations match real statutes |
| **Personalization rate** | % of responses that reference at least one user-specific fact from profile | > 80% for users with 3+ legal facts |
| **Action completion** | % of users who generate a demand letter / rights summary after a chat | > 15% of chat sessions |
| **Profile growth rate** | Average new legal facts extracted per conversation | > 0.5 facts/conversation |
| **User retention signal** | Conversations per user per month (returning users) | > 4 conversations/month by month 3 |

### Structured Logging Schema

All backend logs use structlog with consistent fields: `event`, `user_id`, `legal_area`, `profile_facts_count`, `state`, `response_latency_ms`, `background_tasks[]`, `timestamp`. This schema enables post-launch analytics: response latency by legal area, profile growth curves by user cohort, and citation accuracy audits by state.
